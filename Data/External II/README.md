This dataset can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/siim-covid19-detection). To download, you will need to create a Kaggle account, then join the competition. In our study, to speed up data handling, we performed image preprocessing on the Kaggle website and downloaded the smaller PNGs. The notebook is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/kawaiikeewee/convert-siim-dicom-to-png).
